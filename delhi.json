  "paragraph": "Delhi (/ˈdɛli/, Hindustani pronunciation: [d̪ɪlliː] Dilli; Devanāgarī: दिल्ली), officially the National Capital Territory of Delhi, is the capital territory of the Republic of India.[5] Delhi is historically and culturally connected to both the Upper Doab[6] of the Yamuna-Ganges river system and the Punjab region.[7] It is bordered by Haryana on three sides and by Uttar Pradesh to the east. It is the second most populous city in India—about 1,484 square kilometres (573 sq mi). It has a population of about 16.3 million, making it the second most populous city and second most populous urban agglomeration in India and 3rd largest urban area[8] in the world.[9][10] Such is the nature of urban expansion in Delhi that its growth has expanded beyond the NCT to incorporate towns in neighbouring states and at its largest extent can count a population of about 25 million residents as of 2014.[11] After Mumbai, Delhi has the second-highest number of billionaires and millionaires among all cities in India."
